### Features

-   limited support for Map & Set entries ([145e7f5](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/commit/145e7f5))
-   numeric array indices are preserved - close [#11](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/issues/11) ([595a2ec](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/commit/595a2ec))
-   Set instances will be treated as arrays - close [#13](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/issues/13) ([8318389](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/commit/8318389))

### BREAKING CHANGES

-   non-numeric array members are ignored

## [2.1.2](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/compare/v2.1.1...v2.1.2) (2019-03-03)

### Docs

-   fix typos

## [2.1.1](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1) (2019-03-03)

### Bug Fixes

-   **map-functions:** will ignore undefined - i.e. may be composed with a filter ([6a84aaa](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/commit/6a84aaa))
-   **rotate-entry:** rotateEntryBy wasn't exported :-/ ([32ff8af](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/commit/32ff8af))

# [2.1.0](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/compare/v2.0.1...v2.1.0) (2019-03-03)

### Features

-   **rotate-entries:** expose rotateEntryBy - close [#9](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/issues/9) ([fa4153e](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/commit/fa4153e))

## [2.0.1](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1) (2019-03-03)

### Docs

-   tweaks to readme & runkit examples

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/compare/v1.0.0...v2.0.0) (2019-03-03)

### Features

-   **iterator:** filters entries when map function returns undefined ([2ed8e9e](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/commit/2ed8e9e))

### BREAKING CHANGES

-   **iterator:** in deepEntries() & deepEntriesIterator(), yield now ignores entries where a transform has returned undefined - effectively allowing entries to be filtered

# [1.0.0](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/compare/v0.3.2...v1.0.0) (2019-02-25)

### Bug Fixes

-   **iterators:** consistent handling of primitives ([23b7c5b](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/commit/23b7c5b))
-   **map-function:** passively ignore non-function input ([f232314](https://github.com/mylesj/deep-entries/commit/f232314))

### BREAKING CHANGES

-   **iterators:** strings passed as initial input behaved differently to those nested somewhere within a composite type. Primitive input will now return an empty set. _i.e._ `deepEntries('string') !== Object.entries('string')`
